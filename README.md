# The Brainfuck Interpreter

Brainf interpreter written in Rust. Fast, reliable, and easy to install.



## Installation

If you don't have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) yet, install it through
`rustup` as specified [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This
also install `cargo` - Rust's default package manager which we'll use to
install `brainf-rs` in seconds.

Here's what you need to do once you have Rust and Cargo installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharpvik/brainf-rs

cd brainf-rs

cargo install --path .
```
